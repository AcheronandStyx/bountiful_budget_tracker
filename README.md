## Description

Bountiful Budget Tracker is a simple progressive web application which allows a user to track their spending.  
-Users can maintain a balance sheet of incoming and outgoing transactions
-If a user looses network connectivity the application will still function and allow the user to log transactions.
-Any transactions logged while offline are saved in an IndexedDb.
-Any saved transactions are uploaded the moment network connectivity is restored.

You can find the repository here -> [Bountiful Budget Tracker](https://github.com/AcheronandStyx/thinkers_paradise).
The application is deployed via Heroku here -> [Deployment](https://shrouded-sierra-18479.herokuapp.com/).
